Abstract:

Clipboard Scouter is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing tool designed to extract and analyze text and numbers from images copied to the clipboard. It offers various processing modes including text extraction, calculation-based operations, and table conversion. Users can interact with the tool through a GUI developed using Python's Tkinter library, where they can select the processing mode, view results, and toggle between light and dark themes. The application utilizes the Tesseract OCR engine for text recognition, with customization options for OCR modes and language settings. It also features logging capabilities to track errors and operations, and supports configuration through an INI file. The tool is particularly useful for processing text and numbers from screenshots or clipboard images, performing automatic calculations, and formatting output into tables.
